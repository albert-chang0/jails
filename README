# Jails

## About
A virtual-machine-based environment holding proprietary code. The use
of virtual machine is to make it easier to get around certain issues
with containers and chroots. For example, some of the applications that
are jailed spawn their own X server to prevent eavesdropping. While
spawning an X server may not necessarily be impossible with a
container, it is likely easier in a virtual machine.

## Assumptions
The virtual machine technology is kvm-based qemu. This allows a common
virtual machine with overlays that can be used to help save space and
to make each run idempotent.

The base image is a Debian minimal install with at least Firefox ESR
and wm2 installed and located at `/opt/qemu/debian.img`. Note that an
eventual goal is to have a script be able to create the base image
given the installation image.
