# Jails

## About
A virtual-machine-based environment holding proprietary code. The use
of virtual machine is to make it easier to get around certain issues
with containers and chroots. For example, some of the applications that
are jailed spawn their own X server to prevent eavesdropping. While
spawning an X server may not necessarily be impossible with a
container, it is more difficult.

## Assumptions
The virtual machine technology is kvm-based qemu. This allows a common
virtual machine with overlays that can be used to help save space and
to make each run idempotent.

There is also an assumption that PulseAudio is being used on the host,
and possibly other configurations. This will likely change in the
future to make it easier to migrate to other systems, even though
PulseAudio is likely to be available on other systems. Considering this
is meant to be for personal use, there is not a strong need to make so
much configurable.

## TODO
* Configurable passwords for root and user
* Configurable devices (webcam, audio input, audio output)
